# Autodesk Forge Viewer sample extension

This is very simple extension for student [hackaton](https://adncis.timepad.ru/event/593049) It can be a starter kit before exploring complex extensions, such as [Philippe Leefsma](http://twitter.com/F3lipek) [samples](https://github.com/Autodesk-Forge/forge-rcdb.nodejs/tree/master/src/client/viewer.components/Viewer.Extensions.Dynamic)

It is step-by step tutorial that shows how to:
* create basic viewer that shows the model, that is hosted on your server. The model can be downloaded from [Autodesk samples gallery](https://forge-rcdb.autodesk.io/gallery) or extracted from [extract.autodesk.io](https://extract.autodesk.io/)
* create simple extension
* register it
* create own toolbars within Forge viewer interface
* a bit of magic with viewer.navigation and selection
* a bit of magic with colors
